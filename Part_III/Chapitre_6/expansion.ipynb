    "The purpose of this notebook is first of all to align a stack (movie composed of several images) taken by a microscope in order to correct the movements of the microscope between two images. Then, once the images are aligned, each image will be binarized (transformed into a matrix composed of 0 and 1) to distinguish the microcolonies in the background.  Finally, the binarized images will be added together in order to have a global vision of the evolution of each microcolony and to be able to extract information such as the growth rate."
